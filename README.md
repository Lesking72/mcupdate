# mcupdate
Old Minecraft News blog, updated for recent Minecraft versions + companion launcher modification

Note: The old launcher is likely going to stop working after Microsoft finishes consooming the login system.

## Requirements
Java 8 or later (available from https://adoptopenjdk.net/ or from Oracle)  
Many Linux distros come with Java but if not `sudo apt install default-jre` or the equivalent for your distro

## Usage
If you still have the old launcher bootstrap, you must delete it or it will redownload the original launcher.

Put launcher.jar in your .minecraft folder and create a shortcut to launch it

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command line for Windows: `javaw.exe -jar %appdata%\.minecraft\launcher.jar`  

A shell script is available for Linux users to automatically download the files and create a shortcut on the Desktop
