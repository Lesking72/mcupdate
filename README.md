# mcupdate
Old Minecraft News blog, updated for recent Minecraft versions + companion launcher modification

# Installation
1. Install Java 8 if not already installed (available from https://adoptopenjdk.net/ or from Oracle)
2. Download the latest launcher.jar from Mojang's S3: https://launcher.mojang.com/v1/objects/eabbff5ff8e21250e33670924a0c5e38f47c840b/launcher.jar
3. Open launcher.jar with an archive tool
4. Copy the `net` folder from `Release.zip` into `launcher.jar`

# Usage
If you still have the old launcher bootstrap, you must delete it or it will redownload the original launcher.

I reccommend creating a shortcut on the desktop that runs the following command

`java.exe -jar %appdata%\.minecraft\launcher.jar`

I don't care enough to explain it for Linux but if you use Linux you should know what to do.
